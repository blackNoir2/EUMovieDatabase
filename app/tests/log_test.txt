What the log is?

The log on the profile page is designed to track and display a chronological record of important 
user activities and events. It serves as a historical log that captures actions such as successful 
login attempts, account creation, and other relevant interactions within the application. 
The log provides users with a transparent view of their activity history, 
allowing them to review and track their actions over time. 
Additionally, the log can help identify any unexpected behavior or discrepancies in user actions, 
providing valuable information for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.


Goal of the log test
-------------------

The goal of testing the log functionality on the profile page is to ensure that it accurately
captures and displays the relevant user activities and events. The testing aims to verify 
that the log records the expected actions, such as successful login attempts, account creation, 
adding or deleting movies and other significant interactions, in the correct chronological order. 
The goal is also to validate that the log provides a clear and comprehensive history of user actions, 
allowing users to review their activity and facilitating troubleshooting and auditing processes. 
Overall, the testing goal is to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and usability of the log feature in capturing 
and presenting the user's activity history.
