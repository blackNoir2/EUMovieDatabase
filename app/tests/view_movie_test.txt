---------------------------------------- MOVIE TEST SUITE -------------------------------------------------- 


Goal: 

The goal of the view movie testing is to ensure that users can access and view movie details accurately 
and efficiently within the system. The testing aims to verify that the view movie functionality works as intended, 
allowing users to retrieve comprehensive information about specific movies.

The goal is to validate that when the view movie feature is clicked it correctly displays 
relevant and up-to-date details for each movie, including title, synopsis, release date, genre, cast, and other relevant information. 
The testing should ensure that the displayed movie information aligns with the corresponding 
movie's data in the local storage providing users with accurate and reliable information.

Furthermore, the testing should cover scenarios where the user can view the movies in a library as well
as on individual level when a single movie is clicked in order to see its attributes.

Additionally, the testing should validate the user interface aspects of the view movie feature, 
ensuring that the movie details are presented in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. 
This may include checking the layout, formatting, and responsiveness of the movie details page, 
as well as verifying the availability of necessary actions or interactions, such as rating,
favoriting, or adding reviews.
