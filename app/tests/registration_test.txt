---------------------------------------- REGISTRATION TEST SUITES -------------------------------------------------- 

Goal: 

The goal of the registration testing is to ensure a smooth and reliable process for users to create new 
accounts within the system. The testing aims to verify that the registration functionality works as intended, 
allowing users to successfully sign up and gain access to the system's features and functionalities.

The goal is to validate that the registration process captures and validates user input accurately and securely. 
This includes verifying that the required fields are properly enforced, such as username, email address, 
and password, and that any additional optional fields are handled correctly. 
The testing should also ensure that the registration form handles potential errors, such as invalid or 
a registered account, adding links, special characters, or missing required information, and provides appropriate
error messages to guide users in correcting their inputs.

Furthermore, the testing should cover scenarios where the user has correctly registered displaying the
appropriate message.

Additionally, the testing should verify that user data entered during registration is stored correctly in the
local storage and associated with the newly created account. 

Overall, the goal of registration testing is to provide users with a seamless and secure account creation 
experience, allowing them to easily join the system and start utilizing its features.
