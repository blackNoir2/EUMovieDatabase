------------------------------------ Navigation test suites ---------------------------------------------------


Goal: 

The goal of the navigation bar testing is to ensure that the navigation bar, which typically appears at the top 
of the user interface, functions correctly and provides users with intuitive and reliable navigation options
throughout the system. The testing aims to verify that the navigation bar is properly designed, responsive, 
and accessible, allowing users to efficiently navigate between different sections, pages, and functionalities 
of the system.

The goal is to validate that the navigation bar accurately reflects the current user's state, 
such as displaying appropriate links or options based on whether the user is logged in or logged out, 
for example when the user is logged there should be a greeting. 

The testing should cover scenarios where the user is in different states, ensuring that the navigation
bar dynamically adjusts and displays relevant options accordingly.

Additionally, the testing should verify that the navigation bar links and menus are correctly structured 
and organized, providing a logical and easy-to-understand hierarchy of navigation. 
This includes testing the functionality of various navigation elements, such as dropdown menus, 
submenus to ensure they function as expected and facilitate efficient navigation.

Furthermore, the testing should validate the responsiveness of the navigation bar across different screen 
sizes and devices. It should ensure that the navigation bar remains accessible and usable on mobile devices,
tablets, and desktop screens, adapting its layout and behavior accordingly.
