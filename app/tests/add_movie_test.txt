---------------------------------------- ADD MOVIE TEST SUITE -------------------------------------------------- 

Goal: 

The overall goal of this test suite for adding movies is to verify that the system correctly 
handles the process of adding movies to the local storage, ensuring that the movie, series, 
comedies, etc details are accurately captured and stored. The testing aims to validate that the movie information
is correctly displayed and accessible after adding, and that any associated functionalities
 (such as viewing or deleting movies) work as intended. Additionally, the testing hopes to 
identify and handle any potential errors or exceptional cases that may occur during the movie
addition process, ensuring the system's stability and reliability.

Test Case 22 - Negative Test: HTML Injection in Movie Description Field
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Injection Testing:

All input fields throughout the application should be tested for HTML injection vulnerabilities. 
This includes fields such as titles, descriptions, cast, runtime, ratings, and any other user-input fields. 
Verify that the application properly filters and sanitizes user input to prevent the execution of HTML tags, scripts, 
or any other potentially malicious code.

When testing each field, ensure to cover both positive cases (valid input) and negative cases (HTML injection attempts). 
Use common HTML tags, such as <script>, <img>, <a>, <div>, etc., along with various attributes and event handlers to 
validate the effectiveness of the input filtering and sanitization mechanisms.

Record the results of each field test, including whether the HTML tags were filtered and displayed as 
plain text or if any unexpected behavior occurred.

Each field should be tested by using the following html tags

Paste the below html into the field..
