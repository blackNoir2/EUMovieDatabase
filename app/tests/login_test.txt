---------------------------------------- LOGIN TEST SUITE -------------------------------------------------- 

Goal: The goal of the login testing is to ensure that users can securely and successfully log into the system 
using their credentials. The testing aims to verify that the login functionality works as intended, 
providing a reliable and user-friendly process for users to access their accounts.

The goal is to validate that users can enter their correct credentials, such as their registerd email and password,
and successfully authenticate with the system. 

The testing should cover scenarios where users enter incorrect credentials, such as wrong email or password, 
to verify that appropriate error messages are displayed, guiding users to correct their inputs, and finally
the test should cover what happens when the user is not logged and the user navigates to any page that requires
the user to login in order to accessed.

Overall, the testing aims to provide a seamless and secure login experience for users, 
ensuring that the system effectively verifies user credentials and safeguards
