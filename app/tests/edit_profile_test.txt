------------------------------------ EDIT PROFILE TEST SUITES ------------------------------

Goal: 

The goal of the profile editing testing is to ensure that users can effectively modify 
their profile information and that the system accurately updates and reflects these changes. 
The testing aims to verify that the profile editing functionality works as intended, 
allowing users to update their personal details, such as name, email, bio,
and other relevant information. 
 
The goal is to validate that the system properly handles user input, performs necessary
data validation, and securely saves the updated profile information. 
Additionally, the testing should verify that the updated profile information is 
accurately displayed across the system, including user profiles and to also verify that
the fields containg the socials IG, Facebook, TikTok, Youtube links are in the correct form. 

The testing hopes to cover different scenarios, such as updating single or multiple fields, 
handling edge cases, and validating the behavior such as when a social media link does not
match is given field e.g. if a youtube link is entered in Instagram field link,
when invalid or conflicting data is entered. Furthermore, the testing should ensure that any
associated data does not cause conflict with any other fields.
