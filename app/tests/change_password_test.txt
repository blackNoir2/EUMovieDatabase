--------------------------------------- CHANGE PASSWORD TEST SUITE --------------------------------------

Goal: The goal of the password change testing is to ensure that the system handles the process of
changing passwords securely and accurately. The testing aims to verify that users can successfully 
change their passwords, ensuring that the new password is securely stored and associated 
with the user's account. 

The goal is to validate that the password change functionality works as intended, 
allowing users to update their passwords and ensuring the application has successfully stored
their password with their account. The tests does not check if proper security measures are applied
such as password complexity requirements and encryption but it does test if the password meets the required
minimum length . Additionally, the testing should hand scenarios where users encounter errors during the password change process, 
such as providing incorrect current password or mismatched new passwords, to ensure that appropriate error messages 
are displayed and the system remains secure and user-friendly.
