------------------------------------ View profile test suites ---------------------------------------------------


Goal: 

The goal of the view profile testing is to ensure that users can access and view their profile information 
accurately and securely within the system. The testing aims to verify that the view profile functionality works 
as intended, allowing users to retrieve and review their personal details and settings.

The goal is to validate that the view profile feature displays the correct user information, including username,
email address, bio, the number of movies they have added and any other relevant details associated with 
the user's profile. The testing should ensure that the displayed information corresponds to the user's account 
data in the system, providing users with an accurate representation of their profile.

Since the system is limited to one user per browser the the testing does not cover scenarios related to different 
types of user profiles on the same browswer 

Additionally, the testing should validate the security aspects of the view profile feature, ensuring that sensitive 
information is properly protected and accessible only to authorized users. This includes not be able to access 
the profile when the user is not logged in 

Moreover, the testing should consider scenarios where users can customize their profile settings or preferences. 
This includes verifying that users can view and modify their profile information such as 
changing their bio, etc. The testing should ensure that any changes made to the profile
are accurately reflected and persisted in the system.
