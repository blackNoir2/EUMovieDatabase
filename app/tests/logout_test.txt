---------------------------------------- LOGOUT TEST SUITE -------------------------------------------------- 


Goal: The goal of the logout testing is to ensure that users can securely and successfully log out of the system, 
terminating their active session and protecting their account from unauthorized access. 
The testing aims to verify that the logout functionality works as intended, providing a reliable 
and user-friendly process for users to end their session.

The goal is to validate that users can initiate the logout process from various parts of the system, 
such as home page, account settings or navigation menus, and successfully log out. 
The testing should cover scenarios where users are logged in and have an active session,
ensuring that the system properly handles the logout request and clears the user's session data.

Additionally, the testing should verify that the logout process adheres to necessary security measures.
This includes verifying that session tokens or cookies are invalidated upon logout, 
preventing unauthorized access to the user's account even if the session information is compromised 
and preventing the user from simply logging back in by using the back browser. The goal is to ensure that the
logout process effectively terminates the user's session and prevents any further actions on behalf of the user.

Furthermore, the testing should validate that appropriate notifications or messages are
displayed to the user after successful logout, confirming the session termination and providing 
any additional instructions or information, if necessary.

Overall, the testing aims to provide that the application provides a seamless and secure logout experience for users,
ensuring that their active session is properly terminated and their account remains protected.
