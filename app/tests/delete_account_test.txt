
--------------------------- DELETE ACCOUNT TEST SUITE ------------------------------------------------

Goal: 

The goal of the account deletion testing suite is to ensure that the system provides a secure and
reliable process for users to delete their accounts. The testing suite aims to verify that the account 
deletion functionality works as intended, allowing users to permanently remove their accounts 
and associated data from the system. The goal is to validate that the deletion process follows 
the necessary security protocols, such as requiring user authentication and providing 
confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions. 

The testing should also verify that all user data is properly removed from the system, ensuring 
that no residual information remains after the account deletion. Additionally, the testing should handle 
scenarios where users encounter errors or issues during the account deletion process, such as authentication 
failures or technical glitches, to ensure that appropriate error messages are displayed and 
the system maintains its integrity and user-friendliness.
